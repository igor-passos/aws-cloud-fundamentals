# Basic Cloud Architecture – Concept Project

## Scenario

A small company needs:

- A website
- File storage
- Secure access control
- Scalability for traffic growth

## Proposed AWS Solution

- EC2 → Host the web application
- S3 → Store static files and backups
- IAM → Manage user permissions
- CloudWatch → Monitor performance

## Architecture Logic

Users access the website hosted on EC2.
Static assets are stored in S3.
IAM controls administrative access.
CloudWatch monitors system health.

## Objective

This conceptual project demonstrates my understanding of how core AWS services integrate into a simple cloud architecture.
