## EC2
Virtual servers in the cloud.

## S3
Object storage service used to store files and backups.

## IAM
Identity and Access Management. Controls user permissions.

## My Understanding

EC2 is like renting a computer.
S3 is like a digital storage box.
IAM is like the security guard controlling access.
